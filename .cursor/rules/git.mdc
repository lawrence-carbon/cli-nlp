# Git Rules

## Commit Messages
- **Use synthetic but meaningful commit messages**:
  - Focus on **behavior changes**, not implementation details
  - Explain **what** changed and **why**, not **how**
  - Keep messages concise but descriptive

- **Follow Conventional Commits format**:
  - `feat:` New feature
  - `fix:` Bug fix
  - `docs:` Documentation changes
  - `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
  - `refactor:` Code refactoring
  - `test:` Adding or updating tests
  - `chore:` Maintenance tasks
  - `perf:` Performance improvements
  - `ci:` CI/CD changes

- **Examples of good commit messages**:
  - `feat: add support for custom command templates`
  - `fix: resolve config file permission issue`
  - `docs: update installation instructions`
  - `refactor: extract command validation logic`

- **Examples of bad commit messages**:
  - `update code` (too vague)
  - `fix bug` (doesn't explain what)
  - `changed function to use dict instead of list` (implementation detail, not behavior)

## Branch Strategy
- **For significant changes or breaking changes**:
  - Suggest creating a dedicated branch first
  - Use descriptive branch names: `feat/feature-name`, `fix/bug-description`
  - Create PRs for review before merging to master
