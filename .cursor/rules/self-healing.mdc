# Self-Healing Rules

## Updating These Rules
- **Cursor rules files can and must be updated when relevant**:
  - When missing information is discovered
  - When repetitive tasks emerge that should be codified
  - When project patterns evolve
  - When new best practices are identified

## How to Update
- Add new rules when patterns emerge
- Update existing rules when they become outdated
- Remove rules that are no longer relevant
- Keep rules organized and well-commented

## When Updating Rules
- Explain why the rule is being added/changed
- Ensure the rule is clear and actionable
- Consider if the rule applies broadly or is project-specific
- Update the appropriate `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/` directory
